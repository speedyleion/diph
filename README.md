A visual diff written in rust

To be frank, I've never really been a GUI develepor and at the start of this project Rust + GUI frameworks is questionable.
I wanted to play with some more Rust and I have need of a visual diff tool that supports images which allows copying one image to the other.
I wasn't able to find a free one out there so thought why not go down the rabbit hole.

This is more or less a thought experiment.  If you happen across this I wouldn't get your hopes up that anything fruitfull comes of it.
